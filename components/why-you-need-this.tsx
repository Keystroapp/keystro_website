            Keystrokes are an excellent way to demonstrate to your audience what
            you are doing. Show keycap visualizations in a beautifully elegant
            manner on your screen instantly. Displaying keystrokes while
            lecturing, sharing, and recording your screen assists your audience
            in following along effortlessly. Keyboard shortcuts are also crucial
            for application demonstrations, presentations, and instructional
            videos. Allow your audience to observe the keys you are pressing, so
            you can concentrate on your main topic.
